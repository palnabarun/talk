# Any problem in computer science can be solved by introducing an extra level of indirection.

## -- David Wheeler

---

# Agenda

- TODO

---

# Need for parallel computing

- TODO

- This section talks about the need for data scientists to perform
parallel computing/processing by mentioning examples from their day to
day life.

---

# Present Tools

- TODO

- This section will talk about ThreadPool, ProcessPool, their API and
their limitations.

---

# Going serverless

- TODO

- This section will talk about the dynamic nature of serverless architecture and its
ability to scale beautifully with atomic and ephemeral workloads.

---

# Building the right indirection

- TODO

- This section deals with how LambdaPool came into the picture with an insight into its internal working.

---
# Benefits of the tool

- TODO
- This section provides some comparison metrics like time saved using LambdaPool, the costs benefits of computing, the developer time saved.

---

# Future Goals

- TODO

- Talks about ThreadPoolExecutor API and how this simplifies again the
way a data scientist works.
